# Travel Journal
## A vacation tracking app

For this React project, i used a `data.js` file rather than an API just for learning purposes
- The `data.js` file contains an array of objects, each one representing one `entry` (aka location) in the travel journal app
- Each object has a ID value

I learnt about the following:
- Using props in components for reusability
- Passing props to components
- Destructuring props
- Using `.map()` to turn an array of data into components for cleaner, declarative code
- Using an ID for the key prop
- Using the spread operator `...entry` to spread key-value pairs in objects as separate props for cleaner code
