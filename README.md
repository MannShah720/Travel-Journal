For this React project, i used a data.js file rather than an API just for learning purposes
- The data.js file contains an array of objects, each one representing one "entry" or location in the travel journal app
- Each object has a ID value

I learnt about the following:
- Using props for components
- Passing props to components
- Destructuring props
- Using .map() to turn data into components for cleaner, declarative code
- Using an ID for the key prop
- Using the spread operator to spread key-value pairs in objects as separate props for cleaner code
